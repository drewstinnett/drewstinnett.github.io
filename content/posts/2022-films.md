## Top 5 In-Theater Films

![best-in-theater-films](/images/2022-films/best-theater.png)

* [ X](https://letterboxd.com/film/x-2022/) Super fun horror and well made throw-back horror film. Lots of awesome gory deaths and great characters. Honorable mention for it's surprise sequel [Pearl](https://letterboxd.com/film/pearl-2022/) which didn't make the top 5, but was still really fun.
* [Babylon](https://letterboxd.com/film/babylon-2022/) One of two amazing movies about the magic of films this year (Shout out to [The Fabelmans](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-fabelmans/)). Great spectacle and music set in old Hollywood. Excited to see this one again.
* [The Banshees of Inisherein](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-banshees-of-inisherin/) Always excited for whatever Martin McDonagh does. Still doesn't beat [In Bruges](https://letterboxd.com/film/in-bruges/) or [Seven Psychopaths](https://letterboxd.com/film/seven-psychopaths/), but still great.
* [Bones and All](https://letterboxd.com/film/bones-and-all/) Best coming of age cannibal movie of the decade for sure!
* [Scream 5](https://letterboxd.com/film/scream-2022/) Never had a ton of nostalgia for the Scream films outside of the first one, so wasn't super excited to see this, but wow, what a fun time! Excited for part 6!

## Top 5 Prestige Films

![prestige](/images/2022-films/prestige.png)

If we've talked in person over the last year or so, you're probably sick of hearing this, but one of the 'projects' I started, was to watch as many of the [Official Letterboxd 250 Narrative Films](https://letterboxd.com/willy15/list/top-250-narrative/). I had only seen about 100 of them pre-2022, so I was able to mostly get through the rest this year. I've just got a few left on the list, but here are the top 5 so far!

* [Harakiri](https://letterboxd.com/film/harakiri/) Samarai revenge style movie told through flashbacks. So good.
* [All That Jazz](https://letterboxd.com/film/all-that-jazz/) Decadant song and dance movie that I always thought sounded boring...glad to be proven wrong here.
* [Stalker](https://letterboxd.com/film/stalker/) This was only the second Tarkovsky movie I'd ever seen (The first being [Solaris](https://letterboxd.com/film/solaris/)). While I don't fully understand what was happening in the movie, and may never, it was still a really cool and haunting film that I'll never forget.
* [Cinema Paradiso](https://letterboxd.com/film/cinema-paradiso/) This movie has been popping up in my recommendation list for a long time, but was another one that just looked boring to me. Way wrong, the movie is amazing. Oddly another film about the magic of movies, I guess that's a theme.
* [The Best of Youth](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-best-of-youth/) That's right, the movie is 6 hours long and in Italian. Mateo!! üò≠ü§å

## Top 5 New Horror

Excluding items in the In-Theater Top 5, these are my top 5 new horror films for the year.

![horror](/images/2022-films/horror.png)

* [Speak No Evil](https://letterboxd.com/film/speak-no-evil-2022/) If you want to ruin an evening, watch this movie.
* [Mad God](https://letterboxd.com/film/mad-god/) Super fun stop motion horror
* [Fresh](https://letterboxd.com/film/fresh-2022/) Surprisingly good Hulu horror movie. Made me sick to my stomach a couple times. üëçüëç
* [The Cursed](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cursed-2021/) Werewoof movie with a really bad CGI werewolf. As long as they aren't showing the wolf though, it's really great
* [Barbarian](https://letterboxd.com/film/barbarian-2022/) Muh bay bay!!

## Movies with a still shot that lasts so long I had to make sure I didn‚Äôt accidentally pause the movie multiple times

![still](/images/2022-films/still.png)

Unfortunately, as part of the 'prestige' watch list previously mentioned, I've had to adjust my expectations around movie pacing. Only 2 films on this specific list.

* [Satantango](https://letterboxd.com/film/satantango/) A 7 hour 'vibe' film...Can't say I hated it, but wow are there some long still shots.
* [Sleep has her House](https://letterboxd.com/film/sleep-has-her-house/) I guess it's the best film I've watched that has neither dialogue or characters.

## 5 Worst In-Theater Films

All films are important in some way, except these 5, they sucked

![worst](/images/2022-films/worst.png)

* [Prey for the Devil](https://letterboxd.com/film/prey-for-the-devil/) Dumb posession movie where literally every exciting scene was spoiled in the trailer
* [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://letterboxd.com/film/avatar-the-way-of-water/) As someone who enjoyed the first one, I was expecing at least some memorable moment or experience with the new movie, but nope. Space whales...üôÑ
* [Sonic the Hedgehog 2](https://letterboxd.com/film/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/) I think it was better than the first one at least
* [Morbius](https://letterboxd.com/film/morbius/) "To bats...it's lethal. To humans, it's deadly" ü§î
* [Jurassic World Dominion](https://letterboxd.com/film/jurassic-world-dominion/) Forgot everything about this movie as the credits rolled
