Lots of awesome gory deaths and great characters. Honorable mention for it&amp;rsquo;s surprise sequel Pearl which didn&amp;rsquo;t make the top 5, but was still really fun. Babylon One of two amazing movies about the magic of films this year (Shout out to The Fabelmans). Great spectacle and music set in old Hollywood. Excited to see this one again.</description></item><item><title>Best Films of 2021</title><link>https://drewstinnett.github.io/posts/film-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 20:11:01 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://drewstinnett.github.io/posts/film-2021/</guid><description>These are all new films I watched over the last year. To qualify, the film had to be new-to-me, and pretty close to being released in 2021.
Top 5 In-Theater Films Pig - Best Nic Cage movie of the year, and contender for best film of the year. Not quite what I was expecting to see, but super beautiful and touching all the way through. In the Heights - First solo movie trip of the year.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://drewstinnett.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 15:42:48 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://drewstinnett.github.io/about/</guid><description>Thanks for stopping by the page!
